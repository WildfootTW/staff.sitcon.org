SITCON Internal Tracking & Conference Operation Network (Codename Roboconf) for Students' Information Technology CONference (SITCON). The website is used to operate though SITCON's administration process since 2014.

Proposed Functionalities
------------------------
* Document operations
* Issue tracker
* Time control
* Staff management

Requirements
------------
Python package dependency are enlisted in [requirements file](requirements.txt).

You could safely remove these packages if you’re not targeting PostgreSQL databases:

* dj-database-url
* psycopg2

[Compass](http://compass-style.org) and [Fabric](http://fabfile.org) powers site theming and automating respectively.

Development
-----------
It is recommended to use `virtualenv`.

	cd roboconf
	virtualenv venv
	. venv/bin/activate # if you use bash

Install dependencies.

	pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

Set debug

	export DEBUG=1 # bash

Copy example settings

	cp core/settings/local_settings.example.py core/settings/local_settings.py

	...

Load database schema and initial data

	python manage.py migrate
	python manage.py loaddata */fixtures/*.json

_Note: currently there are problems with error message : Invalid template library specified. ImportError raised when trying to load 'core.templatetags.markdown': No module named 'html5lib.sanitizer'
try to command : pip install html5lib==0.9999999_

_Note: currently there are problems with loaddata on `master` branch, see commit 5d8436149cf22f0_

Production Deployment
---------------------
We recommend using PostgreSQL. Create a role and a database then grant all privileges to that role:

	sudo -u postgres psql

	CREATE ROLE roboconf WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'foobar';
	CREATE DATABASE roboconf;
	GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE roboconf to roboconf;

It is recommended to use `virtualenv`.

	cd roboconf
	virtualenv venv
	. venv/bin/activate # if you use bash

Install dependencies.

	pip install -r requirements.txt

Load database schema and initial data

	python manage.py migrate
	python manage.py loaddata */fixtures/*.json

_Note: currently there are problems with loaddata on `master` branch, see commit 5d8436149cf22f0_

	python manage.py collectstatic

Make media folder

	mkdir media
	chmod www-data:www-data media

Compiling SCSS
--------------
Install relevant rubygems

	gem install compass zurb-foundation

Compile SCSS to CSS:

	compass compile --force --sass-dir core/scss/ --css-dir core/static/css/ --require zurb-foundation

Alternatively, you can use Fab to compile:

	fab compass:compile

Naming
------
"Roboconf" pronounces familiar with 蘿蔔坑 (redish pit), from the Mandarin idiom "each redish has its own pit". Literally it stands for "robot-assisted conference" in English.
